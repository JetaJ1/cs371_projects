Statement: I worked on the main server loop, creating a portal for new users to join the network. I also created
the rudimentary `Send()` and `Recv()` paradigm for our peer network where each `send()` is accompanied by a wait for an ack
from the other to ensure the client and server wait for each other before continuing.
