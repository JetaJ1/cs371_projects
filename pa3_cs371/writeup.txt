Statement: I created cipher.js and solved the cipher using an online source for most common English letters alongside Dakota's freqAnalyze.py.
I also assisted in file creation and organization for our group, such as creating writeup.txt and documentation.txt and the formats for those documents.

I also created the initial github repo that we all coordinated our work on.
